            The New York metropolitan area is home to the largest and most prominent ethnic Chinese population outside of Asia, hosting Chinese populations representing all 34 provincial-level administrative units of China. The Chinese American population of the New York City metropolitan area was an estimated 893,697 as of 2017, constituting the largest and most prominent metropolitan Asian national diaspora outside Asia. New York City itself contains by far the highest ethnic Chinese population of any individual city outside Asia, estimated at 628,763 as of 2017.<br/><br/>New York City and its surrounding metropolitan area, including Long Island and parts of New Jersey, is home to 12 Chinatowns, districts where Chinese immigrants were made to live for economic survival and physical safety that are now known as important sites of tourism and urban economic activity. Six Chinatowns (or nine, New York including the emerging Chinatowns in Elmhurst and Whitestone, Queens, and East Harlem, Manhattan) are located in New York City proper. Chinese communities are also located in more suburban areas such as Jersey City, New Jersey, Nassau County, Long Island; Edison, New Jersey; West Windsor, New Jersey; and Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey.<br/><br/>China City of America in Sullivan County, New York is proposed in 2012 but whose development has stalled due to the 2022 arrest of its CEO. Dragon Springs (in Deerpark, Orange County, New York) serves as the de facto headquarters for both the global Falun Gong New religious movement as well as its Shen Yun performance arts troupe.<br/><br/>The Chinese American community in the New York metropolitan area is rising rapidly in population as well as economic and political influence. Continuing significant immigration from mainland China has spurred the ongoing rise of the Chinese population in the New York metropolitan area; this immigration and its accompanying growth in the impact of the Chinese presence continue to be fueled by New York's status as an alpha global city, its high population density, its extensive mass transit system, and the New York metropolitan area's enormous economic marketplace. As of 2024, illegal Chinese immigration to New York City has accelerated, concentrating in Queens.
