            Edge of the City is a 1957 American crime drama film directed by Martin Ritt in his directorial debut, and starring John Cassavetes and Sidney Poitier. Robert Alan Aurthur's screenplay was expanded from his original script, staged as the final episode of The Philco Television Playhouse, A Man Is Ten Feet Tall (1955), also featuring Poitier.<br/><br/>The film was considered unusual for its time because of its portrayal of an interracial friendship, and was praised by representatives of the NAACP, Urban League, American Jewish Committee and Interfaith Council because of its portrayal of racial brotherhood.<br/><br/>In 2023, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Plot ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Young cowardly drifter Axel Nordmann arrives at the waterfront on the west side of Manhattan, seeking employment as a longshoreman, and giving his name as "Axel North." He goes to work in a gang of stevedores headed by Charlie Malick, a vicious bully, and is befriended by Tommy Tyler, who also supervises a stevedore gang and has an engaging, charming sense of humor. Malick resents blacks and is antagonized when Axel goes to work for Tommy.<br/><br/>Axel moves into Tommy's neighborhood and becomes friends with Tommy's wife Lucy and develops a romantic relationship with her friend Ellen Wilson. Tommy serves as a mentor to Axel, urging him to stand up to Malick, and that if he does he will be "ten feet tall." It is apparent from the start that Axel is hiding something, and it emerges that he is a deserter from the United States Army. Malick is aware of that, and is extorting money from him.<br/><br/>Malick frequently tries to provoke Tommy and Axel into fights, with Tommy coming to Axel's aid. Malick finally provokes Tommy into a fight, with both men using their baling hooks.
