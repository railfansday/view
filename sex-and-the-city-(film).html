            Sex and the City (marketed as Sex and the City: The Movie) is a 2008 American romantic comedy film written and directed by Michael Patrick King in his feature film directorial debut. It serves as a continuation of the HBO television series Sex and the City (1998–2004), and follows the lives of four close friends— Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker), Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall), Charlotte York Goldenblatt (Kristin Davis), and Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon)—as they navigate relationships, careers, and personal challenges in New York City.<br/><br/>The film had its world premiere at Leicester Square in London on May 15, 2008, and was released theatrically in the United States on May 30. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics—many describing it as an extended episode of the series—it was a major commercial success, grossing $418.8 million worldwide against a $65 million budget. A sequel, Sex and the City 2, was released in 2010, followed by a revival series, And Just Like That..., which premiered in 2022.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Plot ==<br/><br/>A few years after the events of the television series, Carrie Bradshaw and Mr. Big are in a committed relationship and preparing to move in together. They find an expensive penthouse in New York City, which Big agrees to purchase. Concerned about her lack of legal rights if they separate, Carrie considers selling her apartment to contribute financially. Big proposes marriage, and Carrie accepts.
