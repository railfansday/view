            A city manager is an official appointed as the administrative manager of a city in the council–manager form of city government. Local officials serving in this position are referred to as the chief executive officer (CEO) or chief administrative officer (CAO) in some municipalities.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Responsibilities ==<br/><br/>In a technical sense, the term "city manager", in contrast to "chief administrative officer" (CAO), implies more discretion and independent authority that is set forth in a charter or some other body of codified law, as opposed to duties being assigned on a varying basis by a single superior, such as a mayor.<br/><br/>As the top appointed official in the city, the city manager is typically responsible for most if not all of the day-to-day administrative operations of the municipality, in addition to other expectations.<br/><br/>Some of the basic roles, responsibilities, and powers of a city manager include:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Supervision of day-to-day operations of all city departments and staff through department heads;<br/><br/>Oversight of all recruitment, dismissal, disciplining and suspensions;<br/><br/>Preparation, monitoring, and execution of the city budget, which includes submitting each year to the council a proposed budget package with options and recommendations for its consideration and possible approval;<br/><br/>Main technical advisor to the council on overall governmental operations;<br/><br/>Public relations, such as meeting with citizens, citizen groups, businesses, and other stakeholders (the presence of a mayor may alter this function somewhat);<br/><br/>Operating the city with a professional understanding of how all city functions operate together to their best effect;<br/><br/>Attends all council meetings, but does not have any voting rights<br/><br/>Additional duties that may be assigned by the council<br/><br/>The responsibilities may vary depending upon charter provisions and other local or state laws, rules, and regulations. In addition, many states, such as the states of New Hampshire and Missouri, have codified in law the minimum functions a local "manager" must perform. The City Manager position focuses on efficiency and providing a certain level of service for the lowest possible cost. The competence of a city manager can be assessed using composite indicators.<br/><br/>Manager members of the International City/County Management Association (ICMA) are bound by a rather rigid and strongly enforced code of ethics that was originally established in 1924. Since that time the code had been up-dated/revised on seven occasions, the latest taking place in 1998.
