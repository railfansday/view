            During its four-century history, New York City has been known by a variety of alternative names and euphemisms, both officially and unofficially. Frequently shortened to simply "New York", "NY", or "NYC", New York City is also known as "The City" in some parts of the Eastern United States, in particular, the State of New York and surrounding U.S. states. New Yorkers also use "The City" to refer specifically to the borough of Manhattan.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Common nicknames ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Big Apple – first published as a euphemism for New York City in 1921 by sportswriter John J. Fitz Gerald, who claimed he had heard it used the year prior by two stable hands at the New Orleans Fair Grounds because of the large prizes available at horse races in New York. Later made popular by a 1970s advertisement campaign.<br/><br/>The Capital of the World – made popular in its application to New York by the author E. B. White in his 1948 essay Here is New York, written as construction of the United Nations headquarters began that year. Derived in turn from the Roman poet Lucan who first mocked his city of Rome as "Caput Mundi" in the year 61 in his work Pharsalia because of how easily it had fallen to generals the previous century. Also used with adjectives such as "The Food Capital of the World" or "The Gay Capital of the World", in reference to New York City's outsized influence upon specific cultures.<br/><br/>The Center of the Universe – used repeatedly by New York City mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. during his terms from 1954 to 1965, it is also commonly applied to Times Square specifically, and similarly used with adjectives such as the "Theatrical Center of the Universe" or "Economic Center of the Universe"<br/><br/>The City So Nice They Named It Twice – a reference to "New York, New York" as both the city and state, spoken by Jon Hendricks in 1959 on a jazz cover of Lorenz Hart and Richard Rodgers' song "Manhattan" on George Russell's album New York, N.Y., and popularized by New York-based late night talk show host David Letterman, who also used the phrase "the town so nice, they named it twice."<br/><br/>The City That Never Sleeps – first recorded in full in newspaper articles in the early 1900s, including in 1907 in Phoenix, Arizona in reference to New York's evening mail delivery and in 1912 in Fort Wayne, Indiana about New York's new electric and gas lighting, though also recorded in similar forms in reference to the nightlife in neighborhoods like the Bowery as early as 1892 and likely in use during the 1880s.
