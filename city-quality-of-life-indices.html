            City Quality of Life Indices are lists of cities that are ranked according to a defined measure of living conditions. In addition to considering the provision of clean water, clean air, adequate food and shelter, many indexes also measure more subjective elements including a city's capacity to generate a sense of community and offer hospitable settings for all, especially young people, to develop social skills, a sense of autonomy and identity.<br/><br/>The reason some cities appear in one ranking but not another is often related to the different criteria used between rankings, but more commonly it is related the difference in weighting given to similar factors.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== The EIU's Global Liveability Ranking ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) publishes an annual Global Liveability Ranking, which ranks 140 cities for their urban quality of life based on assessments of their stability, health care, culture, environment, education and infrastructure.<br/><br/>Melbourne, Australia, had been ranked by the EIU as the world's most livable city for seven years in a row, from 2011 to 2017. Between 2004 and 2010, Vancouver, Canada, was ranked the EIU's most livable city, with Melbourne sharing first place in the inaugural 2002 report. Vancouver has ranked third since 2015, while Vienna, Austria, ranked second until 2018 when it climbed to the top spot.<br/><br/>The Syrian capital, Damascus, was ranked the least livable city of the 173 assessed in 2024.<br/><br/>The EIU also publishes a Worldwide Cost of Living Survey that compares the cost of living in a range of global cities.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Monocle's Quality of Life Survey ==<br/><br/>Since 2006, the lifestyle magazine Monocle has published an annual list of livable cities.
