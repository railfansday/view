            Steven Michael Fulop (born February 28, 1977) is an American politician serving as the 49th mayor of Jersey City, New Jersey. A Democrat, he was formerly the Councilman for Jersey City's Ward E. On May 14, 2013, Fulop defeated incumbent mayor Jerramiah Healy.<br/><br/>Fulop assumed the office of mayor on July 1, 2013. He was widely considered likely to run for governor in 2017, but ended this speculation by announcing his intention to run for re-election as mayor. In November 2017, Mayor Fulop was re-elected as mayor of Jersey City with 78% of the vote which represented the largest margin of re-election by a Jersey City mayor since 1949. He was again re-elected in 2021, becoming the first Jersey City mayor to win a third term since Frank Hague. On January 3, 2023, Fulop announced that he will not seek reelection in 2025. Instead, in April 2023, he announced he would run to succeed term-limited Governor Phil Murphy in the 2025 New Jersey gubernatorial election.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Fulop was born in Edison, New Jersey, to Jewish parents, Carmen and Arthur Fulop.  His parents were both born in Romania.
