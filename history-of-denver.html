            This article details the history of the City and County of Denver, Colorado, the United States from its founding in 1858 to the present. Since the gold rush, Denver has been Colorado's gateway and major metropolis. With its location at the intersection of the plains and the mountains, its people and institutions have tied together the sections of the state and served as a point of contact between Colorado and the wider world. As the state’s political capital and largest city, Denver has been the natural center for decision-making. New programs and ideas have typically spread outward through public agencies and private organizations that have Denver headquarters.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== 19th century ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Pike's Peak Gold Rush and first settlements ===<br/><br/>The Denver area, part of the Territory of Kansas, was sparsely settled until the late 1850s. Occasional parties of prospectors came looking for gold, then moved on. In July 1858, Green Russell and Sam Bates found a small placer deposit near the mouth of Little Dry Creek (in the present-day suburb of Englewood) that yielded about 20 troy ounces (620 g) of gold, the first significant gold discovery in the Rocky Mountain region. News spread rapidly and by autumn, hundreds of men were working along the South Platte River.  By spring 1859, teams of thousands of gold seekers arrived and the Pike's Peak Gold Rush was under way.
