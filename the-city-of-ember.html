            The City of Ember is a post-apocalyptic novel by American writer Jeanne DuPrau that was published in 2003. The story is set in Ember, an underground city threatened by aging infrastructure and corruption. It follows two young protagonists, Lina Mayfleet and Doon Harrow, as they follow clues left behind by the original builders of the city to search for safety in the outside world.<br/><br/>It is the first installment in the Books of Ember series, which also includes The People of Sparks, The Prophet of Yonwood (a prequel), and the final installment, The Diamond of Darkhold. In 2008, the book was adapted into a film by Walden Media and Playtone.<br/><br/>A graphic novel adaptation by comic book artist Niklas Asker was released on September 25, 2012.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Plot summary ==<br/><br/>As Earth is being ravaged by a series of apocalyptic events known as the Disaster, a coalition of architects, scientists, and doctors known as the Builders construct an underground city named Ember to ensure humanity survives, with the intention that future generations of the city will not know about the outside world or that they live underground. They build the city to last for two centuries, after which the citizens of Ember will evacuate and return to the surface world. The Builders give the first mayor of the city a box with a timed lock set to open after 200 years, containing instructions explaining how to leave Ember. The box is passed successfully from mayor to mayor, until the seventh mayor who, thinking it could contain a cure for the deadly coughing disease he contracted, takes the box home and tries multiple times to break it open, but fails.
