            Flint is the largest city in Genesee County, Michigan, United States, and its county seat. Located along the Flint River 66 miles (106 km) northwest of Detroit, it is a principal city within the Mid Michigan region. Flint had a population of 81,252 at the 2020 census, making it the 12th-most populous city in Michigan. The Flint metropolitan area is located entirely within Genesee County and is the third-largest metro area in Michigan, with a population of 406,892 in 2020. The city was incorporated in 1855.<br/><br/>Flint was founded as a village by fur trader Jacob Smith in 1819 and became a major lumbering area on the historic Saginaw Trail during the 19th century. From the late 19th century to the mid-20th century, the city was a leading manufacturer of carriages and later automobiles, earning it the nickname "Vehicle City". General Motors (GM) was founded in Flint in 1908, and the city grew into an automobile manufacturing powerhouse for GM's Buick and Chevrolet divisions, especially after World War II up until the early 1980s recession. Flint was also the home of a sit-down strike in 1936–37 that played a vital role in the formation of the United Auto Workers.<br/><br/>Since the late 1960s, Flint has faced several crises.
