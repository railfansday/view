            Baltimore is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Maryland. With a total population of 585,708 at the 2020 census, it is the 30th-most populous U.S. city. Baltimore was designated as an independent city by the Constitution of Maryland in 1851. Baltimore is the most populous independent city in the United States. As of 2020, the population of the Baltimore metropolitan area was 2.84 million, the 20th-largest metropolitan area in the country. The city is also part of the Washington–Baltimore combined statistical area, which had a 2020 population of 9.97 million, the third-largest in the country. Though Baltimore is not located within or under the administrative jurisdiction of any county in the state, it forms part of the central Maryland region, together with the surrounding county that shares its name.<br/><br/>The land that is present-day Baltimore was used as hunting ground by Paleo-Indians. In the early 1600s, the Susquehannock began to hunt there. People from the Province of Maryland established the Port of Baltimore in 1706 to support the tobacco trade with Europe and established the Town of Baltimore in 1729.
